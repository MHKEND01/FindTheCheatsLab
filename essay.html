    <p> Trying to find cheaters through correlations is a grossly inefective method,
      since correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. It's entirely possible
      that the grades between two students have a high correlation by complete coincidence.
      It's also possible that the grades between two students have a high correlation because
      of some other influencing variable. Perhaps those two students study together, or perhaps
      they think in similar ways. From the correlations alone, you can't even tell if two students
      provided the same answers to the same questions. You can only compare their overall score. Perhaps
      two students happened to have similar homework scores, but they answered different questions correctly.
      That situation would not be indicative of copying. </p>
